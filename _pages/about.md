I am Yae Jee Cho, a second-year Ph. D student at Carnegie Mellon University.

I am advised by [Prof. Gauri Joshi](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gaurij/home.html), in the [Optimization, Probability and Learning (OPAL) Lab](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gaurij/Group.html). Our research group is affiliated with the [Parallel Data Lab](https://www.pdl.cmu.edu/index.shtml). My current research interests are in optimization theory and distributed machine learning, in particular, federated learning.

Before joining OPAL, I worked at Mercedes-Benz Korea as a Research & Development Engineer in the Drivers Assistance Systems division. I have previously worked with [Prof. Chan-Byoung Chae](http://cbchae.yonsei.ac.kr/) on analytical channel modeling in wireless communication, vehicular communication, and molecular communications.

I also enjoy playing the piano, walking my dog, and volunteering during my free time.
